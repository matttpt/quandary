/// An authoritative DNS server, abstracted from any underlying network
/// I/O provider.
///
/// The [`Server`] structure implements the message-processing logic of
/// an authoritative DNS server. It receives, parses, and responds to
/// DNS messages through the [`Server::handle_message`] method. An
/// underlying network I/O provider is responsible for receiving these
/// messages from the network through whatever operating system I/O APIs
/// are chosen, and then sending the responses that the [`Server`]
/// produces.
///
/// The [`Server`] in turn produces responses based on its catalog of
/// [`Zone`]s loaded into memory. Currently, only one [`Zone`] is
/// supported. A [`Server`] is created to serve a [`Zone`] with
/// [`Server::new`].

    /// `response_buf` is a buffer into which a response message may be
    /// serialized. Its length is interpreted as the maximum size of a
    /// DNS message the caller is willing to send. To comply with the
    /// DNS specification, it should be at least 512 octets long for UDP
    /// transport. For TCP transport, the maximum possible size (65,535
    /// octets) should be used. If the buffer is not long enough to hold
    /// a DNS message header, then this method will panic.

        // fact, RFC 1996 *requires* servers to accept records in the
        // authority and additional sections of NOTIFY messages in case
        // future versions of NOTIFY make use of them. So our strategy
        // is to ignore the RRs that we're not yet concerned with and to
        // allow opcode-specific handling to deal with them (or, for
        // e.g. QUERY and NOTIFY, ignore them).
        //
        // We do, however, need to skip over them here to process
        // pseudo-RRs like OPT or TSIG. This raises the question: should
        // we attempt to parse/decompress them (and return FORMERR if
        // they are invalid)? This would be nice and fastidious, and
        // some servers seem to do it. Furthermore, we *may*, for
        // certain opcodes, need that data later. But on the other hand,
        // it would be good to avoid pedantically parsing a bunch of
        // superfluous RRs in a QUERY, for example. We don't want an
        // attacker slowing us down by feeding us tons of junk records,
        // or trying to blow up our memory usage by sending lots of
        // unused RRs with compressed domain names (especially if we're
        // running on a thread-per-TCP-connection I/O provider).
        //
        // So instead, we do the bare minimum necessary: parsing the
        // first "chunk" of each RR owner (up to the null label or a
        // pointer label) to find the RDLENGTH field, and then using the
        // RDLENGTH field to get to the end of the RR. Thus, if there
        // are superfluous RRs with invalid data, we let it slide. That
        // seems okay---after all, this is an authoritative server, not
        // a DNS message validation service!
