/// An authoritative DNS server, abstracted from any underlying network

///
/// The [`Server`] structure implements the message-processing logic of
/// an authoritative DNS server. It receives, parses, and responds to
/// DNS messages through the [`Server::handle_message`] method. An
/// underlying network I/O provider is responsible for receiving these
/// messages from the network through whatever operating system I/O APIs
/// are chosen, and then sending the responses that the [`Server`]
/// produces.
///
/// The [`Server`] in turn produces responses based on its [`Catalog`]
/// of [`Zone`](crate::zone::Zone)s loaded into memory. A [`Server`] is
/// created to serve a [`Catalog`] with [`Server::new`].

        // We do, however, need to skip over them here to process
        // pseudo-RRs like OPT or TSIG. This raises the question: should
        // we attempt to parse/decompress them (and return FORMERR if
        // they are invalid)? This would be nice and fastidious, and
        // some servers seem to do it. Furthermore, we *may*, for
        // certain opcodes, need that data later. But on the other hand,
        // it would be good to avoid pedantically parsing a bunch of
        // superfluous RRs in a QUERY, for example. We don't want an
        // attacker slowing us down by feeding us tons of junk records,
        // or trying to blow up our memory usage by sending lots of
        // unused RRs with compressed domain names (especially if we're
        // running on a thread-per-TCP-connection I/O provider).
        //
        // So instead, we do the bare minimum necessary: parsing the
        // first "chunk" of each RR owner (up to the null label or a
        // pointer label) to find the RDLENGTH field, and then using the
        // RDLENGTH field to get to the end of the RR. Thus, if there
        // are superfluous RRs with invalid data, we let it slide. That
